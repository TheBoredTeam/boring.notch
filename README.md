Welcome to **Boring.Notch**, the coolest way to make your MacBook's notch the star of the show! Forget about those boring status bars‚Äîour notch turns into a dynamic music control center, complete with a snazzy visualizer and all the music controls you need. It's like having a mini concert right at the top of your screen!
